This is the capstone project 
Title: Foldercleaner
explaination of the output in docfile
In this we make 5 file named file1 to file5 
In which we considered file 3 is empty,
file4 is old then 12 months ,
file5 is less time accessed then input,
file2 has everything perfect and 
file1 has two entries wich is one older than the other 
So it deletes file1,file3,file4 and file5


file.txt is input file
